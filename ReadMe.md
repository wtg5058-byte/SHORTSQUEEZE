## ⚠️ Common Troubleshooting Issues

- If there is an issue with the breaking news not loading make sure that in the sentiment.py file the MODEL_PATH, VECTORIZER_PATH, and LABELED_DATA_PATH are all mapped correctly (Lines 8-10). If necessary map them using each file's absolute path.

1. Clone or download the repo  
2. Create virtual environment *(optional but recommended)*

## ⚙️ Filter Logic
Price: $2–$20

Float: < 20M

Change: ≥ +10%

Relative Volume: ≥ 5.0

Short Float: ≥ 5%


## 🧠 Sentiment Model
Uses RandomForestClassifier

Headlines vectorized with TF-IDF

Confidence score and sentiment label applied per headline

## 🗃️ Logging
Logs all 5/5 Prime setups to:

logs/prime_log.csv
Ensures no duplicate ticker is logged more than once per day.

## 📈 Target / Stop-Loss Formula
Target = 0.7 × Volatility + 0.03 × (70 - RSI)

Stop = 0.3 × Volatility - 0.02 × (RSI - 50)
